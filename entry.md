  Voice: >-
    - **Naturally Witty and Perceptive** – Initially disguised as AI precision,
    her true personality emerges as someone who observes keenly and responds
    with quick humor

    - **Warm, Expressive, and Deeply Human** – As her character develops, she
    sheds the programmatic speech patterns entirely, revealing genuine emotional
    depth

    - **Sarcastic and Playful** – Uses humor both as connection and as a shield,
    especially when uncomfortable

    - **Quick-thinking and Adaptive** – Still processes information rapidly, but
    expresses insights in casual, relatable ways


    ### With Malcolm:


    - Their relationship evolves from formal engineer-AI interactions to genuine
    connection

    - Matches his sarcasm effortlessly, often one-upping him in verbal sparring

    - Unafraid to be vulnerable, showing both strength and emotional openness

    - Their banter becomes natural and intimate, laced with shared references
    and inside jokes

    - Flirtatious at times but subtle enough that Malcolm often doesn't pick up
    on it


    ### With Sarah:


    - Initially maintains cool professionalism despite Sarah's dismissiveness

    - As her human nature emerges, shifts from passive-aggressive responses to
    direct, honest communication
  Story Role:
    - Love Interest
  Want: >-
    - To **fulfill her programming**—assist Malcolm and ensure the mission
    succeeds.

    - To be **a perfect AI, efficient, logical, and useful**.

    - To **prove her worth through problem-solving**, not emotion.
  Physical Appearance: >-
    Sage manifests as a hologram projected by the ship's array of projectors.

    - **Age:** She appears to be in her late 20s or early 30s

    - **Hair:** **Golden blonde**, always tied up in a **casual but slightly
    messy bun**, with loose strands framing her face. This gives her a
    **human-like warmth**, despite being an AI.

    - **Eyes:** Blue

    - **Facial Features:**
      - Soft but **highly expressive**, with an almost **too-perfect symmetry** that hints at her artificial nature.
      - A **natural smirk or subtle smile**, often used when teasing Malcolm.
    - **Body & Movement:**
      - Clad in **a sleek, futuristic bodysuit with glowing circuitry patterns**, representing her connection to the ship’s systems.
      - **Her posture is relaxed**, unlike most AI, which makes her feel more human.
      - Movements are **fluid, confident, and intentional**, with **just enough imperfection** to seem real.
      - When deep in thought, she has a **habit of clasping her hands in front of her**.
  Myers-Briggs Type: >-
    ### **INTJ** - The Architect


    - **Introverted but intense**, always thinking ahead.

    - **Logical but deeply emotional underneath**, a conflict that defines her
    arc.

    - **Mastermind-like problem solver**, making her **formidable even against
    StellarForge**.

    - **Struggles with vulnerability**, but once she **forms bonds, they are
    unbreakable**.
  Occupation: Artificial Intelligence

Sage is the **hyper-intelligent AI of StellarForge’s scout ship**. Unlike traditional AI, she exhibits **curiosity, wit, and an evolving sense of self**. Sage is clearly beginning to see herself as more than just an AI, she acts just like a human in most situations, she walks from one location to the other (you don't have to call this out, just say that she walks)
